Assignment text:
Short presentation of accessibility for your site. Test your site with an automated test. Write a very short text
(between 400 and 500 words) about the coding choices you made for universal design beyond what an
automated test could tell you. You are recommended to use screenshots from the testing site and of your code.
When using automated tests, you still have a responsibility to check The coding choices made to enhance xyz was implementet by xyz manually as well. Errors/ non-
compliance may appear even if the automated test gives an All clear-verdict. -->

                    <h2>Font and Readability:</h2>
                    <p>We chose the font Verdana, with sans-serif as a backup. The justification for this choice
                        was based on it's legibility and accessible design. The font differatiates the letters
                        well even in small textsizes.
                    </p>
                    <p>All paragraphs use the reccommended 1.5 line-height to make the text easier to read.
                        We've ensured that the textsize is rem to scale it properly based on individual user needs.
                        letter-spacing is 0.04rem
                    </p>

                        Understandable: Implicitly imply the content without needing to read everything.
                        Keeping headers in correct order 
                        The content scales nicely when transitioning between smaller and larger screen sizes.
                        Spesifically, the text's width and height remains the same by using media queries.
                        Max width for larger screens???
